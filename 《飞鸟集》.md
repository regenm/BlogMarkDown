# 《飞鸟集》

​	记录一些个人比较喜欢的短诗。

> Do not seat your love upon a precipice because it is high.

---

>  We, the rustling leaves, have a voice that answers the storms, but who are you so silent
> I am a mere flower.

---

> Your voice, my friend, wanders in my heart, like the muffled sound
> of the sea among these listening pines. 

---

>  Let life be beautiful like summer flowers and death like autumn leaves.

---

>  Not hammer-strokes, but dance of the water sings the pebbles
>
> 不是槌的打击，乃是水的载歌载舞，使鹅卵石臻于完美。
>
> 记起来这句诗我在高中班级里开班会时用过，主题是**水**来着。

---

> 世界以痛吻我，我报之以歌。
>
> The world has kissed my soul with its pain, asking for its return

---

>  The best does not come alone.
> It comes with the company of the all.

---

>  当我去时，让我的思想到你那里来，如那夕阳的余光，映在沉默的星天边上。
> Let my thoughts come to you, when I am gone, like the after glow of
> sunset at the margin of starry silence.
