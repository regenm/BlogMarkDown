* # Information gathering	

Based on --AT89C51.

>The **Atmel AT89 series** is an [Intel 8051](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_8051)-compatible family of 8 bit [microcontrollers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microcontroller) (μCs) manufactured by the [Atmel Corporation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmel).
>
>Based on the Intel 8051 core, the AT89 series remains very popular as general purpose microcontrollers, due to their industry standard instruction set, their low unit cost, and the availability of these chips in DIL (DIP) packages. This allows a great amount of legacy code to be reused without modification in new applications. While less powerful than the newer AT90 series of [AVR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmel_AVR) [RISC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RISC) microcontrollers, new product development has continued with the AT89 series for the aforementioned advantages.
>
>More recently, the AT89 series has been augmented with 8051-cored special function microcontrollers, specifically in the areas of [USB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Serial_Bus), [I²C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I²C) (two wire interface), [SPI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_Peripheral_Interface) and [CAN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Controller_Area_Network) bus controllers, [MP3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MP3) decoders and hardware [PWM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulse-width_modulation).

​						**The following I would not like to just write down the points. The post will be focused on application layer**





# Project_1_1：**TIME BOMB**

​	It's actually pretty much easier to make a TIME BOMB than you can imagine.You will just need some TNT and an at89c51 chip(<3).

Now we fixed the Bomb (got some TNT). What about the  timer ? Yep, we can use the AT89C51 chip. 

```c
void delayN10ms(unsigned int N){
	unsigned int i;
	for(N;N>0;N--)
	for(i=1275;i>0;i--);         //different types of chips have different delay functions
    						   //and it's also related to the crystal oscillator
}
```

what about the next to do after the timer is set? yep , light it.

We can use a switch or a relay to light it . When the switch (connected between vcc and gnd) is on , the heat will light the TNT. EZ game.

 ```c
 void delayN10ms(unsigned int N){
 	unsigned int i;
 	for(N;N>0;N--)
 	for(i=1275;i>0;i--);         //different types of chips have different delay functions
     						   //and it's alse related to the crystal oscillator
 }
 
 void main()
 {
     
     delayN10ms(10000);//10s
     P1=0x00;
 }
 ```

# project_1_2 : CANCEL the TIME BOMB

​	Now that we create a time bomb , we are going to  use it to rob a bank . However your 

incompetent teammates set the bomb too early! You guys are to be exposed to TNT in just 10s . What are you going to do ? 

* Yes ,for sure you can reset the chip. 
* Also we can use a technique called **INTERRUPTION**

The microcontroller gets the address of the ISR from the interrupt vector table and jumps to it It starts to execute the interrupt service subroutine until it reaches the last instruction of the subroutine which is RETI (return from interrupt)

**example code using external interrupt **

```c
void main(void){
 IP = 0x04; 
 EA=1;
 EX0=1; // allow external interrupt INT0
 IT0 = 1; // set edge triggering
 	delayNms(10000);//10s
    P1=0x00;        //start BOMB
}
void int0(void) interrupt 0{

   P1=0xff;			//cancel the timer
	P2=0x00; 		//to display
    delayN10ms(1000); // increase 10s for your survive
    P2=0xff; 		//to display
}
```

Now you can run away safely ;D.

**The above codes are just some rough examples . **

# Project_1_3 : the final version of the time bomb

## 		First , we are going to design the schematic seriously. 

![the final schematic](/images/finalbomb.png)

### **codes:**

```c
#include<reg51.h>

sbit button_1=P2^4;

void delayNms(int N)		//@11.0592MHz
{
	unsigned char i;

	while(N){
		for(i=1275;i>0;i--);
	N--;
	}
}

void bombStart();


void main(){
	
	//setup
	 IP = 0x04; 
		EA=1;
		EX0=1; // allow external interrupt INT0
		IT0 = 1; // set edge triggering
		P2 =0xff;
		while(1){
			if(button_1==0){
				bombStart();
				}
		}
}

void bombStart(){
	delayNms(10000);
	P1=0x00;
}
void int0(void) interrupt 0{ 

   P1=0xff;//cancel the timer
	delayNms(10000); // increase 10s for your survive
}
```

**explanations:**

1. Once the bomb is set up , you need to press the start button to start the bomb.
2. Once you start the bomb , you have 10 s to run away .
3. If you want to delay the bomb , press the button "PAUSE" .
   * **ps**: there is no way you can cancel the bomb unless you reset or cut off the power .

**other information**

```c
IT1 = 1; // Enable external interrupt 1 to trigger by a falling edge signal. 

IT1 = 0; // Enable a low level signal on external interrupt 1 to generate an interrupt.

IT0 = 1; // Enable external interrupt 0 to trigger by a falling edge signal.

IT0 = 0; // Enable a low level signal on external interrupt 1 to generate an interrupt.
```

# Project_1_4: Use a TIMER interrupt to  set the bomb

​	To control the timer and specify our needs/logic we have to configure the timers first. For configuring and controlling the 89c51 microcontroller timers we have four registers. These registers are associated with timers of 89c51 micro controller. Each register plays an important role in controlling and configuring the timer. 

> **Registers that are associated with timers.  **
>
> - 
> - (Timer Control register)
> - TMOD   (Timer Mode register)
> - TH0/TL0 (Timer 0, 16-bit register, High bits goes to TH0, Low bits goes to TL0)
> - TH1/TL1 (Timer 1, 16-bit register, High bits goes to TH1, Low bits goes to TL1)

### TH0/TL0(Timer-0) = TH1/TL1(Timer-1)

These two registers TH and TL are timer high byte and timer low byte registers. 0 and 1 are the timers numbers. These are 16-bit registers. we Load our time delays/counter value in these registers. Recall 8051 timer counter can count up to 65535 and 16 bits cover 65535 in binary. Since 8051(89c51,89c52) is an 8-bit microcontroller, so to load 65535 we need two registers one representing the high byte and other the low byte. we access these register in two bytes one byte for TH(timer high byte) and TL(timer low byte). TH and TL together makes 16-bits(TH 8-bit, TL8-bit).  TH0 and TL0 are byte addressable only.

* how to set them then ? There is an  example .

> ![Calculating Delay for 8051(89c51,89c52) microcontroller](https://b2600043.smushcdn.com/2600043/wp-content/uploads/2/2/1/5/22159166/1434719730.png?lossy=0&strip=1&webp=1)

### TCON(Timer control) Register of 8051 Microcontroller

TCON(Timer Control) is an 8-bit register. It’s bits are used for generating interrupts on gpio pins internal or external. The most important bits of the timers TRx and TFx are also in it. TRx(timer run) and TFx(timer overflow) bits which we use in almost all our timer applications are in it. When we initialize TRx with 1, TRx=1 it means start the timer, When the specified time is over the timer it self make TFx=1 which means that the delay value is reached. Once TFx=1 stop the timer by initializing TRx with 0 TRx=0(Stop Timer). Now if we again want to run the timer make TRx=1. In the diagram you can see the SFR for TCON register, the bit’s used for interrupt handling and the timer run and timer over flow bits. If you want to access the individual bits of the registers, you can access them by their names. You can also access whole register it self by its name. At the bottom of the page their is a small example explaining it. 

## Now we are going to upgrade our Bomb!

```c
#include <REGX52.H>
 
sbit led=P2^4;
 
int cnt=0;
 
void Time0Init(void)
{
	//配置定时器0工作模式16位计时
    //set T0 working mode with 16 bits
	TMOD&=0xF0;
    TMOD|=0x01;
	//给初值，定制10ms
    //set initial value , create 10 ms delay
	TL0=0x00;
	TH0=0xDC;
	
	TR0=1;//开始计时
    		// turn on T0
	TF0=0;
	
	//打开定时器0中断
    //turn on T0 interrupt
	ET0=1;
	//打开总中断
    // turn on general interrupt
	EA=1;
}
 
void main()
{
	
	led=1;
	
	Time0Init();
	
	while(1)
	{
		;//do noting
	}
}
 
void Time0Rountime()  interrupt 1
{
			cnt++;//cnt++用来记录第一次爆表，cnt是1次
    // record the interrupt times
			//重新给初值
    //reset the initial value
			TL0=0x00;
			TH0=0xDC;
			if(cnt==1000)//爆表100次，经过10s，led就亮
                // after 100 times which the time passes 1s
			{
				cnt=0;//当1s时，让count从0开始，计算下一次的1s
                // set the cnt again
				P1=0x00;//BOMb!!!
			}
}
```





## 1. What if we get many BOMBs which they are set at different palces ?

* **Explode with a delay ( such as 1 s )**

> Solution KEY : 
>
> ​				Once the first BOMB is about to explode , it sends a signal to another BOMB.
>
> **the signal :**
>
> 1. Voltage （like 0 v  ---> 1 v  or reverse it ）
> 2. Waves of Voltage ( PULSE )
> 3. Plain text 
> 4. Cipher text 

## 1. Voltage

​	Once the first bomb is about to explode, it sends a Voltage signal to the second and so on.

​	We can use one of a pin to do this work .

* The first BOMB

```c
void main()
{
    
    delayN10ms(10000);	 //10s
    P2.1=0; 			// send a signal ( 5v ) 
    P1=0x00;
}
```

* The second BOMB

```c
void main()
{
 	while(1){   
    	if(P2.1==0){
            delayN10ms(10000);	 //10s
            P2.2=0; 			// send a signal to the third BOMB (send to P2.1) ( 5v ) 
            P1=0x00;
        }
    }
}
```

## 2. Through Plain Text（by serial ）

**The first BOMB.**

* Transmit  signal ( We only use the send module, so we just need one pin ( **TX** ))

```c
#include <reg51.h>
void main()
{
 unsigned char Message[5]={"BOMB!"};
 char i;
            		 //Initialize 
 TH1=0xFD;  		 //Set timer 1 for BAUD=9600
 TMOD=0x20;  		 //Set Timer 1 in Mode 2 8-bit Auto reload          
 SCON=0x50;   		 //Set serial reception enable and Mode 1 8-bit UART
 TR1=1;    		     //Start Timer 1

					//Serial Transmission of message
  for (i=0;i<5;i++)
  {
   SBUF =Message[i];  //Send one by one each byte to serial
   while(TI==0);      //Wait for Transmition complition
   TI=0;     		 //Clear Transmit Intterupt flag
  }

				    //Serial Reception
  while(1)
  {
   while(RI==0);     //Wait unitl RI low
    P1=SBUF;  
   RI=0;
  }
}
```

![plainTextBomb](/images/plainTextBomb.png)

The second BOMB

* Receive the signal from the last BOMB
* Transmit signal to the third

```c
#include <REGX52.H>
void UartInit()		//9600bps@11.0592MHz
{
	PCON &= 0x7F;		//波特率不倍速
	SCON = 0x50;		//8位数据,可变波特率
	TMOD &= 0x0F;		//清除定时器1模式位
	TMOD |= 0x20;		//设定定时器1为8位自动重装方式
	TL1 = 0xFD;			//设定定时初值
	TH1 = 0xFD;			//设定定时器重装值		
	TR1 = 1;			//启动定时器1
	ET1 = 0;        	//禁止定时器1中断
	EA=1;				//开放总中断 
	ES=1;				//开放串口中断
}
void Uartsend(unsigned char byte)//发送
{
	SBUF=byte;//把数据写入发送缓冲区SBUF
	//数据发送完成的标志是TI=1；所以等待数据传送完
	while(TI==0);
	TI=0;//软件清零
}
void UART_ISR() interrupt 4//串口中断函数
{
	if(RI==1)//接收中断
	{
		Uartsend(SBUF);//把接收的数据发送到计算机
		RI=0;//软件清零
	}
}	
int main()
{
	UartInit();
	while(1)
	{
		
	}
}
```

![The Second BOMB](/images/plainTextSecondBomb.png)

**The THird BOMB.**

Actually do the same thing as the second one .

* Receive the signal from the last BOMB
* Transmit signal to the third

```c
#include <REGX52.H>
void UartInit()		//9600bps@11.0592MHz
{
	PCON &= 0x7F;		//波特率不倍速
	SCON = 0x50;		//8位数据,可变波特率
	TMOD &= 0x0F;		//清除定时器1模式位
	TMOD |= 0x20;		//设定定时器1为8位自动重装方式
	TL1 = 0xFD;			//设定定时初值
	TH1 = 0xFD;			//设定定时器重装值		
	TR1 = 1;			//启动定时器1
	ET1 = 0;        	//禁止定时器1中断
	EA=1;				//开放总中断 
	ES=1;				//开放串口中断
}
void Uartsend(unsigned char byte)//发送
{
	SBUF=byte;//把数据写入发送缓冲区SBUF
	//数据发送完成的标志是TI=1；所以等待数据传送完
	while(TI==0);
	TI=0;//软件清零
}
void UART_ISR() interrupt 4//串口中断函数
{
	if(RI==1)//接收中断
	{
		Uartsend(SBUF);//把接收的数据发送到计算机
		RI=0;//软件清零
	}
}
int main()
{
	UartInit();
	while(1)
	{
		
	}
}
```
